# Jobs - Data Pipeline Orchestration

This directory contains orchestration logic for data processing jobs and workflows.

## Purpose

The Jobs layer is responsible for:
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Coordinating data processing workflows across layers
- **Job Scheduling**: Managing job execution schedules and dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Tracking job performance and data processing metrics
- **Resource Management**: Managing compute resources and optimization

## Design Principles

- **Functional Orchestration**: Jobs composed of pure, testable functions
- **Idempotency**: All jobs can be safely rerun without side effects
- **Dependency Management**: Clear job dependencies and execution order
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring throughout execution
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle varying data volumes and processing loads

## Job Types

Common job categories include:
- **Ingestion Jobs**: Bronze layer data ingestion from source systems
- **Processing Jobs**: Silver layer data cleansing and validation
- **Aggregation Jobs**: Gold layer business aggregations and analytics
- **Utility Jobs**: Maintenance, monitoring, and operational tasks
- **ML Pipeline Jobs**: Machine learning model training and inference

## File Structure

- `ingestion/` - Bronze layer ingestion job definitions
- `processing/` - Silver layer processing job definitions
- `aggregation/` - Gold layer aggregation job definitions
- `utilities/` - Maintenance and operational jobs
- `schedules/` - Job scheduling and dependency configurations
- `monitoring/` - Job monitoring and alerting logic

## Usage Pattern

```python
from jobs.ingestion import ingest_customer_data
from jobs.processing import process_transactions
from jobs.aggregation import calculate_daily_metrics

# Define job pipeline
pipeline = JobPipeline() \
    .add_job(ingest_customer_data) \
    .add_job(process_transactions, depends_on=['ingest_customer_data']) \
    .add_job(calculate_daily_metrics, depends_on=['process_transactions'])

# Execute pipeline
pipeline.run()
```

## Orchestration Frameworks

Supports integration with:
- **Apache Airflow**: DAG-based workflow orchestration
- **Databricks Workflows**: Native Databricks job orchestration
- **Azure Data Factory**: Cloud-native data pipeline orchestration
- **Prefect**: Modern workflow orchestration with Python
- **Custom Schedulers**: Framework-agnostic job execution

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Job execution status and duration tracking
- Data quality metrics and threshold monitoring
- Resource utilization and performance metrics
- Failure detection and automated alerting
- Historical job performance analysis

## AI-Driven Orchestration

- Intelligent job scheduling based on data patterns
- Automated resource optimization and scaling
- Predictive failure detection and prevention
- Smart retry logic with adaptive backoff strategies
