# Deployment - CI/CD and Infrastructure Management

This directory contains deployment configurations, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure management scripts.

## Purpose

The Deployment directory is responsible for:
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and validation pipelines
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to different environments
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure provisioning and management
- **Environment Management**: Configuration for development, staging, and production
- **Release Management**: Version control and release automation

## Design Principles

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined in version-controlled code
- **Environment Parity**: Consistent configurations across all environments
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive testing integrated into deployment pipelines
- **Security First**: Security scanning and compliance checks in all pipelines
- **Observability**: Monitoring and logging integrated into deployment processes

## Directory Structure

- `ci_cd/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions and configurations
- `infrastructure/` - Infrastructure as Code templates and scripts
- `environments/` - Environment-specific configurations
- `docker/` - Docker containers and containerization configs
- `kubernetes/` - Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- `terraform/` - Terraform infrastructure provisioning

## CI/CD Platforms

Supports multiple CI/CD platforms:
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow definitions for GitHub repositories
- **Azure DevOps**: Pipeline configurations for Azure environments
- **Jenkins**: Jenkinsfile and pipeline scripts
- **GitLab CI**: GitLab CI/CD pipeline configurations
- **Databricks Workflows**: Native Databricks deployment pipelines

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Zero-downtime deployments with traffic switching
- Full environment validation before traffic cutover
- Instant rollback capabilities

### Rolling Deployment
- Gradual deployment across multiple instances
- Continuous availability during updates
- Progressive validation and rollback

### Canary Deployment
- Gradual traffic shifting to new versions
- A/B testing and performance validation
- Risk mitigation through controlled exposure

## Environment Management

### Development Environment
- Rapid iteration and testing capabilities
- Lightweight infrastructure and services
- Developer-friendly tooling and debugging

### Staging Environment
- Production-like environment for final validation
- Complete end-to-end testing workflows
- Performance and load testing capabilities

### Production Environment
- High availability and disaster recovery
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Security hardening and compliance controls

## Infrastructure Components

### Compute Resources
- Databricks clusters and job configurations
- Kubernetes pods and service definitions
- Serverless function deployments
- Virtual machine provisioning

### Storage Resources
- Data lake storage configurations
- Database provisioning and management
- Backup and disaster recovery setup
- Data retention and lifecycle policies

### Networking and Security
- VPC and network security configurations
- Load balancer and ingress configurations
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- Identity and access management

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Deploy to development environment
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh development

# Deploy to staging with validation
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh staging --validate

# Production deployment with approval
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh production --require-approval

# Infrastructure provisioning
terraform -chdir=deployment/terraform apply -var-file=environments/prod.tfvars
```

## Security and Compliance

- Secret management and rotation
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Compliance validation and reporting
- Access control and audit logging
- Encryption in transit and at rest

## Monitoring and Observability

- Application performance monitoring integration
- Infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Distributed tracing and debugging
- SLA monitoring and reporting
