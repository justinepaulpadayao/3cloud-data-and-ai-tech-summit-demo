# Tests - Comprehensive Testing Framework

This directory contains comprehensive tests for all components of the data engineering framework.

## Purpose

The Testing framework is responsible for:
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between different system components
- **Data Quality Testing**: Validating data transformations and quality rules
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete data pipeline workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Ensuring system performance under various loads

## Design Principles

- **Functional Testing**: Tests mirror the functional programming approach of the codebase
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Use representative test datasets for realistic validation
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in isolation
- **Repeatability**: Tests produce consistent results across runs
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: High test coverage across all code paths

## Test Structure

- `bronze/` - Tests for Bronze layer ingestion and raw data processing
- `silver/` - Tests for Silver layer cleansing and validation
- `gold/` - Tests for Gold layer aggregations and business logic
- `utils/` - Tests for utility functions and shared components
- `jobs/` - Tests for job orchestration and pipeline workflows
- `integration/` - Cross-layer integration tests
- `fixtures/` - Test data fixtures and mock objects

## Testing Frameworks

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework for Python components
- **Great Expectations**: Data quality and validation testing
- **PySpark Testing**: Spark DataFrame testing utilities
- **Mock/Patch**: Mocking external dependencies and services
- **Property-Based Testing**: Using Hypothesis for robust test generation

## Usage Pattern

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific layer tests
pytest tests/bronze/
pytest tests/silver/
pytest tests/gold/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Individual function testing
- Utility function validation
- Transformation logic verification
- Business rule implementation

### Integration Tests
- Bronze-to-Silver data flow
- Silver-to-Gold transformations
- End-to-end pipeline testing
- External system integration

### Data Quality Tests
- Schema validation
- Data completeness checks
- Business rule compliance
- Anomaly detection validation

## Test Data Management

- Use representative but anonymized test datasets
- Implement data factories for test data generation
- Version control test data schemas and expectations
- Isolate test data from production systems

## CI/CD Integration

- Automated test execution on code changes
- Test coverage reporting and thresholds
- Performance regression testing
- Data quality validation in deployment pipeline
