# Scripts - Operational and Maintenance Tasks

This directory contains operational scripts for system maintenance, deployment, and administrative tasks.

## Purpose

The Scripts directory is responsible for:
- **System Maintenance**: Database maintenance, cleanup, and optimization scripts
- **Deployment Automation**: Deployment and environment setup scripts
- **Data Operations**: Data migration, backup, and recovery scripts
- **Development Tools**: Development environment setup and utility scripts
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, performance monitoring, and alerting scripts

## Design Principles

- **Idempotency**: All scripts can be safely executed multiple times
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with clear exit codes and messages
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for audit trails and debugging
- **Configuration**: Externalized configuration for different environments
- **Documentation**: Clear usage instructions and parameter documentation

## Script Categories

- **Setup Scripts**: Environment initialization and dependency installation
- **Deployment Scripts**: Application and infrastructure deployment automation
- **Maintenance Scripts**: Regular maintenance tasks and cleanup operations
- **Backup Scripts**: Data backup and disaster recovery procedures
- **Migration Scripts**: Data and schema migration utilities
- **Monitoring Scripts**: System health checks and performance monitoring

## File Structure

- `setup/` - Environment setup and initialization scripts
- `deployment/` - Deployment automation and CI/CD scripts
- `maintenance/` - Regular maintenance and cleanup scripts
- `backup/` - Data backup and recovery scripts
- `migration/` - Data and schema migration utilities
- `monitoring/` - Health check and monitoring scripts

## Usage Pattern

```bash
# Environment setup
./scripts/setup/install_dependencies.sh
./scripts/setup/configure_environment.sh

# Deployment
./scripts/deployment/deploy_to_staging.sh
./scripts/deployment/deploy_to_production.sh

# Maintenance
./scripts/maintenance/cleanup_old_data.sh
./scripts/maintenance/optimize_tables.sh
```

## Script Standards

- Use appropriate shebang lines (#!/bin/bash, #!/usr/bin/env python3)
- Include comprehensive help text (-h, --help flags)
- Implement proper exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)
- Use configuration files instead of hardcoded values
- Include verbose and quiet modes for logging control

## Security Considerations

- Never hardcode secrets or credentials in scripts
- Use environment variables or secure secret management
- Implement proper file permissions and access controls
- Validate all input parameters and file paths
- Use secure temporary file handling

## Integration

Scripts should integrate with:
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Monitoring systems for health checks and alerting
- Job schedulers for regular maintenance tasks
- Configuration management tools
- Secret management systems
