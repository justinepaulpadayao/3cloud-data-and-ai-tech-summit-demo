# Silver Layer - Cleansed and Validated Data

The Silver layer serves as the cleansed and validated data zone in our medallion architecture.

## Purpose

The Silver layer is responsible for:
- **Data Cleansing**: Removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing formats
- **Data Validation**: Implementing comprehensive data quality checks and constraints
- **Schema Standardization**: Applying consistent schemas and data types across sources
- **Business Logic**: Applying initial business rules and transformations
- **Data Enrichment**: Adding derived columns and calculated fields

## Design Principles

- **Functional Transformations**: All operations implemented as pure, composable functions
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive validation and quality checks at every step
- **Idempotency**: All transformations are repeatable and produce consistent results
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing and schema enforcement throughout the pipeline
- **Auditability**: Complete lineage and transformation tracking

## Transformation Types

Common transformations include:
- Data type standardization and casting
- Null value handling and imputation
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Data format standardization (dates, addresses, etc.)
- Reference data lookups and enrichment
- Basic business rule application

## File Structure

- `transformations/` - Core data transformation functions
- `validation/` - Data quality and validation logic
- `enrichment/` - Data enrichment and augmentation functions
- `schemas/` - Standardized schema definitions
- `quality/` - Data quality monitoring and reporting

## Usage Pattern

```python
from src.silver.transformations import cleanse_data, standardize_schema
from src.silver.validation import validate_business_rules
from utils.data_processing import apply_transformations

# Apply cleansing and validation pipeline
silver_df = bronze_df \
    .transform(cleanse_data) \
    .transform(standardize_schema) \
    .transform(validate_business_rules) \
    .transform(apply_transformations)
```

## Quality Standards

- All data must pass defined quality checks
- Schema compliance is mandatory
- Business rule violations are flagged and handled
- Comprehensive data profiling and monitoring
- Automated anomaly detection and alerting
