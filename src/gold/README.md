# Gold Layer - Business-Ready Analytics Data

The Gold layer serves as the business-ready, aggregated data zone in our medallion architecture.

## Purpose

The Gold layer is responsible for:
- **Business Aggregations**: Creating business-specific views and aggregations
- **Analytics-Ready Data**: Preparing data for reporting, dashboards, and analytics
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing data structures for query performance
- **Data Marts**: Creating subject-specific data marts for different business domains
- **KPI and Metrics**: Calculating key performance indicators and business metrics

## Design Principles

- **Business-Centric**: All transformations are aligned with business requirements
- **Performance-Optimized**: Data structures optimized for analytical workloads
- **Functional Composition**: Complex business logic built from composable functions
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Implement star and snowflake schemas where appropriate
- **Self-Service Analytics**: Enable business users to easily access and understand data

## Aggregation Types

Common business aggregations include:
- Time-series aggregations (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Customer and product analytics
- Financial metrics and KPIs
- Operational performance indicators
- Risk and compliance metrics
- Marketing and sales analytics

## File Structure

- `aggregations/` - Business-specific aggregation functions
- `metrics/` - KPI and metric calculation logic
- `marts/` - Subject-specific data mart definitions
- `views/` - Business-friendly view definitions
- `reports/` - Predefined report templates and queries

## Usage Pattern

```python
from src.gold.aggregations import calculate_customer_metrics
from src.gold.metrics import compute_kpis
from utils.data_processing import optimize_for_analytics

# Create business-ready analytics data
gold_df = silver_df \
    .transform(calculate_customer_metrics) \
    .transform(compute_kpis) \
    .transform(optimize_for_analytics)
```

## Business Domains

Typical business domains include:
- **Customer Analytics**: Customer lifetime value, segmentation, behavior
- **Financial Analytics**: Revenue, profitability, cost analysis
- **Product Analytics**: Product performance, inventory, pricing
- **Operations Analytics**: Efficiency, quality, capacity utilization
- **Risk Analytics**: Credit risk, operational risk, compliance metrics

## Performance Considerations

- Partitioning strategies for large datasets
- Indexing and clustering for query optimization
- Materialized views for frequently accessed aggregations
- Caching strategies for real-time dashboards
- Data compression and storage optimization
